    <p>The<br> World <br>Is <br>Too <br>Much<br> With <br>Us</p>
    <p> BY <br>WILLIAM <br>WORDSWORTH</p>

    <p>
        The world is too much<br>late with us; <br>late and soon, <br>
        Getting and spending,<br> we lay waste our powers;—<br>
        Little we see in Nature<br> that is ours;<br>
        We have given our hearts <br>away,<br> a sordid boon!<br>
        This Sea that bares <br>her bosom to the moon;<br>
        The winds<br> that will be howling <br>at all hours,<br>
        And are up-gathered <br>now like sleeping<br> flowers;<br>
        For this,<br> for everything,<br> we are out of tune;<br>
        It moves us not. <br>Great God!<br> I'd rather be
        A Pagan suckled in <br>a creed outworn;<br>
        So might I, <br> standing on this pleasant lea,<br>
        Have glimpses<br> that would make me <br>less forlorn;<br>
        Have sight of Proteus <br>rising from the sea;<br>
        Or hear <br>old Triton blow<br> his wreathèd horn.<br>
    </p>
